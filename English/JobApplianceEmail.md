Dear Mr. Musk

As it came to my attention just few days ago you published a poll where you asked the twitter mob if you should step down as twitter CEO and the twitter mob responded 'yes'. Therefore I would like to apply for the position of CEO of twitter.

I have zero years of expirience in the field of being leader of social media giant which puts me directly on par with the last CEO of twitter in terms of qualification. Yet I still posses knowledge and skills which are usefull for the position of twitter CEO. I have 10 years of expirience as shepherd so I am used to managing large herds of sheeps. And I have 45 years of experience of being thinking human being which can somewhat think of consequences of my actions.

As for my other knowledge. 
1. I know that I should not fire whole management the moment I start as new CEO and that I sould wait and see how the team operates before making any radical decision
   - This can help with not making the whole company almost bankrupt beacause of mismanagement
2. I know that I should not fire whole moderation team
   - This is highly beneficial for the platform because with moderation team we can remove harmful and hateful content thus being atractive to advertisers
   - It also prevents catastrophy like I do not know thousands of people spamming n-word
3. I know that I should not fire 50% of workforce withou evaluating their value to the company
   - The old employees know how the company works so I do not need to waste time of my senior employees to teach newcomers everything
   - If I have my development team in tact junior developers don't need to learn whole new codebase from scratch.
   - With working HR we can evaluate the value of employees and fire some of them to cut expenses


Thank You and have a good rest of your day
Alexandr Pleskot
