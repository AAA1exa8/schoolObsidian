Dear Mr. West. Hope you're doing well. Yesterday I returned from my trip to Great Britian organized by your company. It was one week trip to London but it didn't live up to my expecatation. In the airport our plane didn't wait for us and almost departured without us (we were only 15 minutes behind your schedule). In the airplane there was some kid crying the whole time, next time please make it so there are no childerens near us. Also our seats weren't next to each other even tough we bought the trip two weeks in advance. When we got out of the plane all taxis where gone or there were long lines for taxi, you should make some sort of Taxi service in all countries where you organize trips. Then we had to go by bus which was full of people. The bus station was 100 meters from our hotel (the walk was really annoying after the long flight). 

I hope you take these suggestions into consideration.
best regards by your annoying customer.
Karen
